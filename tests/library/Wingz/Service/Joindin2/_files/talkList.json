This session will introduce one of the less-known design patterns in the PHP world, but also one that can greatly improve the decoupling and the testability of your code: Dependency Injection. I will demonstrate how to use Dependency Injection in your projects, and I will take advantage of the PHP 5.3 new features to create a fully-featured DI container live.","start_date":"2010-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","speaker_name":"Fabien Potencier","uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2\/talks\/1241","verbose_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2\/talks\/1241?verbose=yes","comments_link":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2\/talks\/1241\/comments","event_link":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2\/events\/110"},"2":{"talk_id":"1242","event_id":"110","talk_title":"Living with Legacy Code","talk_description":"Legacy code is a burden that few developers are lucky enough to avoid in their professional lives.
